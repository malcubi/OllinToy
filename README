Code:   OllinToy
Author: Miguel Alcubierre
Date:   March, 2005

This program solves the Einstein evolution equations in the case of
1+1 dimensions and vacuum.  The documentation for the code is in the
file "manual.pdf" inside the subdirectory "doc" (it is still
incomplete).  If what you want is not there, or you want more detail,
try looking at the source files directly, they are extensively
commented.
